# SOC_Engineering_Lab
Step into my personal Cybersecurity Home Lab adventure! Get ready to dive into the realm of Microsoft Defender tools. Together, we'll uncover how Defender for Endpoint tackles risks, master administration, and fine-tune Attack Surface Reduction on Windows devices. I'll guide you through device actions, domain and user account investigations, and the nuances of alert settings in Microsoft 365 Defender. As we navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, we'll conduct advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender, deftly manage incidents, and explore the depth of Defender for Identity. Let's delve into DLP alerts, insider risk scenarios, and auto-provisioning within Defender for Cloud Apps. With a focus on remediating alerts in Cloud Apps and crafting impactful KQL statements, we'll extract insights to enhance our defense. Join me in mastering a Sentinel workspace, accessing watchlists, and grasping event formats. We'll connect Azure VMs, configure Sysmon events, and craft sophisticated analytics rules. Brace yourself to design playbooks, hunt down threats, and capture real-time insights through livestream.
